This project focuses on sentiment analysis, which is the computational task of identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text. The goal is to determine whether the sentiment of the text is positive, negative, or neutral. This README file provides an overview of the project's structure, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
Libraries Used
This project utilizes several Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and natural language processing:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For natural language processing tasks, including tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning functionalities, particularly TF-IDF vectorization.
WordCloud: For generating word clouds from text data.
Data Preparation: Place your input data file (e.g., your_data.csv) in the data/ directory. Ensure that your CSV file contains a column with text data that you want to analyze.

Data Preprocessing: Run the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and preprocess your text data. This includes:

Removing special characters and punctuation
Tokenizing the text
Removing stopwords
Stemming the words
Sentiment Analysis: Use the sentiment_model.py script to perform sentiment analysis on the preprocessed data. This script includes:

TF-IDF vectorization of the text data
Training a sentiment analysis model (you can customize the model as needed)
Visualization: Generate visualizations using the visualization.py script. This includes creating:

Word clouds to visualize the most common words in the dataset
Bar charts or other plots to represent sentiment distribution
Testing with Own Data: You can test the model with your own data by modifying the input data file and re-running the analysis scripts.
